This project creates Ml models for the well-known titanic project on kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.

Using the code in this project you can build Random Forst models (sklearn) to predict survival of titanic pasengers.
The best test accuracy obtained (confirmed via submission on the competition page) was 0.78708.

The project relies on python 3.9 and uses mainly the packages pandas, sklearn and nameparser for feature engineering and prediction. Though some more packages were used for exploration, including ppscore and seaborn.
